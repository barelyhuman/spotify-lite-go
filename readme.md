### Spotify Lite (Go Lang)
Simple Spotify Client built in go lang and [fyne](http://fyne.io)


### Motivation
I normally use spotify off a device that's somewhere in the room and siri/google assistant can't hear me at that distance so a simple desktop client.

### Roadmap 
At this point, the primary goal is to have a working client that can change the current track in the playlist and play pause when needed.
Additional Features would include

- Playlists (Add, Remove, Add to, Remove from, Play selected)
- Start Radio of current playing song 
- Change to one of connected devices.
